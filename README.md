# Crimes-Against-Women-In-India

It is 2021. We survived one of the worst years, and hopefully, everything will be back to normal. But one thing which hasn’t changed yet was the number of crimes against women.
We all might be thinking last year everybody were at home, then why didn’t the crime case reduced. Well, domestic violence complaints at a 10-year high during COVID-19 lockdown.
The Main Aim of this project is to show how crimes against women were increasing from 2001 to 2014.
This data was collected from Kaggle. It has state-wise and district level data on the various crimes committed against women between 2001 to 2014. The crimes included are:

Rape
Kidnapping and Abduction
Dowry Deaths
Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty
Insult to modesty of Women
Cruelty by Husband or his Relatives
Importation of Girls
